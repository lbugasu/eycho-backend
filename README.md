## Concept notes for backend

- The features that will differenciate this site from others will be the ability to skip ads - on demand - to achieve this, the algorithm will have to train on some data - how to detect ads.
  It is basically an NLP task. How can one detect ads in a podcast?
- By looking for the following:
  - A break in the pattern/voice of speech,
  - Quotes like "we'll be right back after the break"
  - A different voice speaking. - this usually comes through Ad insertion - where even podcast episodes aired years ago would have recent ads
